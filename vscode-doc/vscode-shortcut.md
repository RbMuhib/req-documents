 6. Creating live template: this called snippets . we can easily create a snippet and use it for repeating lines. To create or edit your own snippets, select User Snippets under `File > Preferences` (`Code > Preferences` on macOS), and then select the language (by language identifier) for which the snippets should appear, or the New Global Snippets file option if they should appear for all languages. VS Code manages the creation and refreshing of the underlying snippets file(s) for you. before this we need to install snippets add-ons.
